# repo-tastesbetter
This application will allow a bike brand or bike shop customer to go through a questionaire on terrain, riding style, budget, brands, components, etc... to easily chose the perfect bike for them
Ideally this application will have the ability to track metrics on customer clicks and be able to send that data into a CRM platform - HubSpot, SFDC, etc...
It should also be able to connect to a DB like lightspeed where it can pull shop inventory data easily
