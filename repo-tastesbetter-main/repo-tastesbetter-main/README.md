# repo-tastesbetter
This application will allow a bike brand or bike shop customer to go through a questionaire on terrain, riding style, budget, brands, components, etc... to easily chose the perfect bike for them
Ideally this application will have the ability to track metrics on customer clicks and be able to send that data into a CRM platform - HubSpot, SFDC, etc...
It should also be able to connect to a DB like lightspeed where it can pull shop inventory data easily
Eventually it would be cool to gather all this data over time and throw it into an AI model where the AI can suggest bikes to customers

Features:
  - Rider Survey: Terrain, riding style, budget, component bias, quantitative reviews
  - Select 3 bike options per completed survey based on responses
  - Give the rider the why behind the selection
  - Show price
  - Images as a user going through the selection process in an intuitive UI
  - Ability to connect to a DB SQL, lightspeed, etc...
  - Ability for the application to connect to a CRM or analytics platform
